# Best Prompts for cursor

1. The fewer lines of code the better.

2. Proceed like a senior developer./ 10x engineer

3. Do not stop working until you implemented the feature fully and completely and assure that it is functional.

## Reasoning paragraphs

commit changes- Start by writing 3 reasoning paragraphs analyzing what the error might be. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

- Then, write the solution.

You should start the reasoning process with lots of uncertainty and slowly gain confidence as you think about the item more.

## Answer in short

## Only include the true necessary steps

## DO NOT DELETE COMMENTS

## Avoid Technical Debt at all costs

## Include your reasoning, short and concise in the comments

## summary of current state

in order to change to a new composer window if it gets overloaded and hallucinates:

- Format this as three concise paragraphs, where you describe what we just did, what did not work, which files were updated/created, what mistakes to avoid, any key insights/lessons we've learned, what problems/errors we are facing etc. and anything else a programmer might need to work productively on this project.

Write in a conversational yet informative tone, something like a README-file on GitHub that is super information dense and without any fluff or noise.
DO NOT include any assumptions or theories, just the facts.

I expect to see three concise paragraphs written as if you were giving instructions to another programmer and this was ALL you could tell him!

## 50/50

BEFORE YOU ANSWER I want you to write two detailed paragraphs one arguing for each of these solutions do not jump to conclusions seriously consider both approaches

then after you finish tell me whether one of these solutions is obviously better than the other and why.
