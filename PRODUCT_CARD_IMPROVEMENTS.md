# Product Card Styling & Availability Badge Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Incorrect Availability Badge

**Problem:** All products were showing "Nicht verfügbar" even when they were available.

**Root Cause:** The availability check in the product card component wasn't using the `is_available` field from Meilisearch data.

**Solution:** Updated the availability logic to prioritize the `is_available` field from Meilisearch:

```typescript
// Check availability - products from Meilisearch have is_available field
// If not present, fall back to checking variant inventory
const isAvailable =
	(product as any).is_available !== undefined
		? (product as any).is_available
		: (product.variants?.some(variant =>
				variant.manage_inventory ? (variant.inventory_quantity || 0) > 0 : true,
			) ?? false);
```

### 2. ✅ Improved Product Card Styling

**Changes Made:**

#### Badge Improvements

- **"Auf Lager" badge** (green): Shows for available products
- **"Anfragen" badge** (red): Shows for unavailable products (better than "Nicht verfügbar")
- Badges now have:
  - Better colors (solid green-500/red-500 with white text)
  - Cleaner rounded corners (`rounded-md` instead of `rounded-full`)
  - Better positioning and shadow

#### Stock Count Badge

- Shows only when product is available AND has inventory
- Displays "{count} Stück" instead of "{count} auf Lager"
- Semi-transparent white background with backdrop blur for modern look
- Positioned top-left (doesn't clash with availability badge)

#### Product Info Section

- **Reduced spacing** (`space-y-2.5` instead of `space-y-3`)
- **Better typography**:
  - Title: `font-semibold` with `leading-tight`
  - Price: Larger (`text-lg`) and `font-bold`
  - Description: `leading-relaxed` for better readability
- **Dark mode support**: All elements now have dark mode variants
- **Category badges**:
  - More compact styling
  - Border separator at top
  - Better dark mode colors

#### Button Improvements

- **Rounded corners**: `rounded-lg` for modern look
- **Better shadows**: `shadow-sm` with `hover:shadow-md`
- **Dynamic text**: Shows "Anfragen" for unavailable products
- **Font weight**: `font-semibold` for better readability

#### Card Container

- Better hover effects: `hover:shadow-lg`
- Dark mode support throughout
- Smoother transitions

## Visual Improvements Summary

### Before

- Round badges that looked bulky
- "Nicht verfügbar" (negative phrasing)
- Too much spacing in product info
- Standard shadows
- Light mode only

### After

- Clean rectangular badges with better colors
- "Anfragen" (positive call-to-action)
- Compact, information-dense layout
- Modern shadows and hover effects
- Full dark mode support
- Larger, bolder prices
- Better typography hierarchy

## Files Changed

1. **`busbasisberlin-storefront/src/modules/store/components/product-card/index.tsx`**
   - Fixed availability badge logic
   - Improved all styling
   - Added dark mode support
   - Better badge text and positioning

## Testing

Test the following scenarios:

1. **Available Products**: Should show green "Auf Lager" badge
2. **Unavailable Products**: Should show red "Anfragen" badge and button text
3. **Stock Count**: Should show "X Stück" badge for available products
4. **Dark Mode**: All elements should have appropriate dark mode colors
5. **Hover Effects**: Cards should have smooth shadow transitions
6. **Categories**: Should show compact category badges with border separator

## Design Principles Applied

- **Information Density**: More information in less space
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between title, description, and price
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, shadows, and smooth transitions
- **Accessibility**: Good color contrast, clear typography
- **Dark Mode**: Consistent experience across themes
- **Call-to-Action**: Clear, positive language for all states
