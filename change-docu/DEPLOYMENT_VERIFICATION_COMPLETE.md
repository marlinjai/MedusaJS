# Complete Deployment Verification - All Edge Cases Covered

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY
**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Verification Level:** Senior DevOps Engineer Review Complete

---

## ✅ ALL 12 EDGE CASES VERIFIED

### **1. Fresh VPS (Cold Start)**

- State: Nothing running
- Action: Starts target deployment (green), creates nginx
- Result: ✅ GREEN running, serving traffic

### **2. Blue Running, Nginx Down**

- State: Blue UP, Nginx DOWN
- Action: Fixes state file, starts nginx with blue config, deploys green
- Result: ✅ GREEN running after switch

### **3. Nginx Crash Loop**

- State: Nginx RESTARTING infinitely
- Action: Stops nginx, removes container, recreates with correct config
- Result: ✅ Nginx recovered, deployment proceeds

### **4. Both Deployments Running**

- State: Blue UP, Green UP (invalid)
- Action: Keeps current per state file, stops other
- Result: ✅ Clean state, proceeds with deployment

### **5. Wrong State File**

- State: Blue running but file says "green"
- Action: Corrects state file to match reality
- Result: ✅ Consistent state

### **6. Deployment Health Check Fails**

- State: New deployment unhealthy after 120s
- Action: Stops failed deployment, keeps old one running
- Result: ✅ Zero downtime, old deployment still serving

### **7. Nginx Switch Fails**

- State: New deployment healthy, nginx won't start
- Action: Attempts rollback if previous deployment exists
- Result: ✅ Falls back or reports manual intervention needed

### **8. No Previous Deployment (Rollback Scenario)**

- State: First deployment ever, rollback requested
- Action: Detects no previous deployment, reports error
- Result: ✅ Clear error message, no crash

### **9. Missing SSL Certificates**

- State: SSL certs don't exist
- Action: Warns but continues, nginx may fail
- Result: ✅ Graceful warning, instructions provided

### **10. Concurrent Deployment Attempt**

- State: Deployment already running
- Action: Lock file prevents second deployment
- Result: ✅ No race conditions

### **11. Git Reset Removes SSL Certs**

- State: Production certs in nginx/ssl/
- Action: Backs up before git reset, restores after
- Result: ✅ SSL certs preserved

### **12. Base Services Down Mid-Deployment**

- State: Postgres/Redis crash during deployment
- Action: start_base_services() restarts them without --remove-orphans
- Result: ✅ Base services recover, deployment containers unaffected

---

## ✅ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

1. **`set -e` Removed** - Allows proper error handling and rollback
2. **`--remove-orphans` Removed** - Prevents stopping deployment containers
3. **`--force-recreate` Removed** - Prevents unnecessary base service restarts
4. **Service Name Fix** - Uses `nginx` not `medusa_nginx` with docker-compose
5. **Missing CORS Vars** - All environment variables now passed correctly
6. **Nginx Config Update** - Container recreated to pick up new config
7. **State Interference** - analyze_and_fix_state() doesn't conflict with deploy()
8. **Rollback Safety** - Verifies previous deployment exists before rollback

---

## ✅ INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED

### **Idempotency**

- ✅ Can run multiple times safely
- ✅ Recovers from any initial state
- ✅ No side effects from repeated runs

### **Fail-Safe**

- ✅ Explicit error handling (no `set -e`)
- ✅ Rollback on failure
- ✅ Old deployment kept running until new one healthy
- ✅ Deployment lock prevents concurrent runs

### **Zero-Downtime**

- ✅ New containers start alongside old
- ✅ Traffic switches only after health checks
- ✅ Old containers stopped only after success

### **Observability**

- ✅ Deployment ID for tracking
- ✅ Duration metrics
- ✅ Deployment history log
- ✅ Smoke tests post-deployment
- ✅ Color-coded logging (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, SUCCESS)

### **Security**

- ✅ SSL certificate preservation
- ✅ File permissions set correctly
- ✅ Secrets via environment variables
- ✅ No secrets in logs

### **Resource Management**

- ✅ Disk cleanup before deployment
- ✅ Unused images pruned
- ✅ Only necessary containers recreated

## 🛡️ FAILURE SCENARIOS HANDLED

### **Scenario A: Green Health Check Fails**

```bash
Steps 1-31: ✓ (green starts)
Step 32: ✗ (health check fails after 120s)
Action:
  ├─ Log error
  ├─ stop_deployment("green")
  └─ exit 1
Result:
  ├─ Blue still running ✓
  ├─ Green cleaned up ✓
  └─ Traffic still served ✓
```

### **Scenario B: Nginx Won't Start with Green Config**

```bash
Steps 1-32: ✓ (green healthy)
Step 33: ✗ (nginx stuck restarting)
Action:
  ├─ Detects restart loop after 5 attempts
  ├─ Shows nginx error logs
  ├─ Return 1
  ├─ deploy() calls rollback()
  │   ├─ Check: blue exists? YES ✓
  │   └─ switch_nginx("blue")
  ├─ stop_deployment("green")
  └─ exit 1
Result:
  ├─ Blue serving traffic ✓
  ├─ Green cleaned up ✓
  └─ Nginx pointing to blue ✓
```

### **Scenario C: Both Deployments Crash**

```bash
Rare scenario: Both blue and green fail health checks
State: No healthy deployment available
Action:
  ├─ analyze_and_fix_state() detects all DOWN
  ├─ Tries to start file_state deployment
  ├─ If fails: manual intervention message
  └─ exit 1
Result:
  ├─ Clear error message ✓
