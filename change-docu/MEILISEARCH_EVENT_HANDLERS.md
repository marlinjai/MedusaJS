# Meilisearch Event Handlers

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Overview

Comprehensive event-driven synchronization system that keeps Meilisearch indexes updated in real-time when data changes occur in Medusa.

## Event Subscribers

### 1. Product Events

**File:** `src/subscribers/product-sync.ts`

**Triggers:**

- `product.created`
- `product.updated`

**Action:** Syncs the specific product to Meilisearch with all related data (categories, variants, pricing, inventory).

**Use Case:** When a product is created or its base information is updated (title, description, handle, status, etc.).

---

### 2. Product Deletion

**File:** `src/subscribers/product-delete.ts`

**Triggers:**

- `product.deleted`

**Action:** Removes the product from Meilisearch index.

**Use Case:** When a product is permanently deleted from the system.

---

### 3. Variant Events

**File:** `src/subscribers/variant-sync.ts`

**Triggers:**

- `product_variant.created`
- `product_variant.updated`
- `product_variant.deleted`

**Action:** Syncs the parent product to Meilisearch to update variant-related data (pricing, SKUs, inventory availability).

**Use Case:**

- New variant added to a product
- Variant pricing changes
- Variant SKU or options change
- Variant deleted

**Why Important:** Variants affect:

- Product availability (`is_available`)
- Price ranges (`min_price`, `max_price`)
- SKU searchability
- Variant count

---

### 4. Inventory-Affecting Events

**File:** `src/subscribers/inventory-meilisearch.ts`

**Important:** Medusa doesn't emit `inventory_level.*` events. Instead, we listen to business events that affect inventory.

**Triggers:**

- `order.placed` - Order reduces inventory
- `order.updated` - Order changes may affect inventory
- `order.canceled` - Order cancellation releases inventory
- `offer.status_changed` - Offer reservations affect availability
- `product_variant.created/updated/deleted` - Variant changes affect inventory

**Action:**

1. Detects which event type occurred
2. Extracts affected product IDs from:
   - Order items (for order events)
   - Offer items (for offer events)
   - Variant data (for variant events)
3. Syncs all affected products in batches

**Use Case:**

- Customer places order (inventory reduced)
- Offer becomes active (inventory reserved)
- Offer cancelled (inventory released)
- Order cancelled (inventory restored)
- Variant inventory settings changed

**Why Important:** These events indirectly affect:

- `is_available` flag (via reservations and actual inventory)
- `total_inventory` count
- Search result filtering by availability

**Note:** This is a **workaround** for Medusa's lack of inventory events. The offer module uses official Medusa workflows (`createReservationsWorkflow`, etc.) but Medusa doesn't emit events for these operations.

### 5. Category Events

**File:** `src/subscribers/category-sync.ts`

**Triggers:**

- `product_category.created`
- `product_category.updated`
- `product_category.deleted`

**Action:**

1. Syncs the category to the `categories` index
2. Finds all products in that category
3. Syncs affected products in batches (10 at a time)

**Use Case:**

- Category renamed or description changed
- Category hierarchy changes
- Category activated/deactivated
- Category deleted

**Why Important:** Category changes affect:

- `category_names` in product index
- `category_paths` (hierarchical navigation)
- Category faceting and filtering
- The `categories` index itself

---

### 6. Collection Events

**File:** `src/subscribers/collection-sync.ts`

**Triggers:**

- `product_collection.created`
- `product_collection.updated`
- `product_collection.deleted`

**Action:**

1. Finds all products in the collection
2. Syncs affected products in batches (10 at a time)

**Use Case:**

- Collection title or metadata changes
- Products need updated collection information

**Why Important:** Collection changes affect:

- `collection_title` (now a filterable attribute)
- `collection_id`
- `collection_handle`
- Collection-based filtering and faceting

---

### 7. Manual Sync Trigger

**File:** `src/subscribers/meilisearch-sync.ts`

**Triggers:**

- `meilisearch.sync` (custom event)

**Action:**

1. Configures both `products` and `categories` indexes
2. Syncs all categories in batches
3. Syncs all products in batches

**Use Case:**

- Initial setup
- Full re-index after configuration changes
- Recovery from sync failures
- Triggered from admin UI

---

## Data Flow

### Example: Inventory Update

```
1. User updates inventory quantity
   â†“
2. Medusa emits "inventory_level.updated" event
   â†“
3. inventory-sync.ts subscriber receives event
   â†“
4. Finds variant_id from inventory_item_id
   â†“
5. Finds product_id from variant_id
   â†“
6. Calls syncProductsWorkflow with product_id filter
   â†“
7. Workflow queries product with full data
   â†“
8. Calculates real-time inventory availability
   â†“
9. Updates Meilisearch with new availability status
   â†“
10. Search results immediately reflect new availability
```

### Example: Category Update

```
1. Admin updates category name
   â†“
2. Medusa emits "product_category.updated" event
   â†“
3. category-sync.ts subscriber receives event
   â†“
4. Syncs category to categories index
   â†“
5. Queries all products in this category
   â†“
6. Syncs products in batches of 10
   â†“
7. Each product gets updated category_names and category_paths
   â†“
8. Search and facets reflect new category name
```

## Performance Considerations

### Batching

- Category/collection changes sync products in batches of 10
- Prevents overwhelming the system with too many concurrent syncs
- Balances speed with resource usage

### Selective Updates

- Only affected products are synced
- Uses filters to target specific products
- Avoids unnecessary full re-indexes

### Real-time Inventory

- Inventory calculations happen during sync
- Uses `getVariantAvailability` for accurate stock data
- Respects sales channel and location settings

## Configuration

All subscribers are automatically loaded by Medusa. No configuration needed.

### Verify Subscribers are Loaded

Check server logs on startup for:

```
info: Subscriber meilisearch-sync.ts loaded
info: Subscriber product-sync.ts loaded
info: Subscriber product-delete.ts loaded
info: Subscriber variant-sync.ts loaded
info: Subscriber inventory-sync.ts loaded
info: Subscriber category-sync.ts loaded
info: Subscriber collection-sync.ts loaded
```

## Testing Event Handlers

### Test Product Sync

```bash
# Update a product via API or Admin UI
# Check logs for: "ðŸ”„ Syncing product {id} due to..."
# Verify in Meilisearch that product data updated
```

### Test Variant Sync

```bash
# Add or update a variant
# Check logs for: "ðŸ”„ Syncing product {id} due to variant {variant_id} change"
# Verify price ranges and SKUs updated in search
```

### Test Inventory Sync

```bash
# Change inventory quantity
# Check logs for: "ðŸ”„ Syncing product {id} due to inventory change"
# Verify is_available flag updated
# Verify product appears/disappears in availability filter
```

### Test Category Sync

```bash
# Update a category name
# Check logs for: "ðŸ”„ Syncing category {id}"
# Check logs for: "ðŸ”„ Syncing X products affected by category change"
# Verify category name updated in product search results
# Verify category facets reflect new name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Products Not Syncing After Update

**Check:**

1. Are subscribers loaded? (Check startup logs)
2. Are events being emitted? (Check event logs)
3. Any errors in subscriber logs?
4. Is Meilisearch running and accessible?

### Inventory Changes Not Reflected

**Check:**

1. Is `inventory-sync.ts` subscriber active?
2. Check logs for "Could not find variant for inventory update"
3. Verify inventory_item_id â†’ variant â†’ product chain
4. Check if sales channel is configured correctly

### Category Updates Not Syncing Products

**Check:**

1. Is `category-sync.ts` subscriber active?
2. Check if products are actually linked to the category
3. Check batch processing logs
4. May need to increase batch size for large catalogs

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for sync errors in production
2. **Batch Size**: Adjust batch sizes based on catalog size
3. **Error Handling**: All subscribers have try-catch blocks
4. **Performance**: Consider debouncing rapid changes
5. **Full Sync**: Run manual sync after major data changes

## Event Coverage Matrix

| Data Type  | Create | Update | Delete | Notes                                               |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Product    | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     | Direct sync via product events                      |
| Variant    | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     | Syncs parent product + inventory check              |
| Inventory  | âœ…\*   | âœ…\*   | âœ…\*   | Via order/offer events (no direct inventory events) |
| Category   | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     | Syncs category index + affected products            |
| Collection | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     | Syncs affected products                             |
| Order      | âœ…     | âœ…     | âœ…     | Syncs products (affects inventory)                  |
| Offer      | -      | âœ…     | -      | Via status changes (affects reservations)           |
| Price      | -      | -      | -      | Covered by variant.updated                          |
| Tags       | -      | -      | -      | Covered by product.updated                          |

**\* Note:** Medusa doesn't emit `inventory_level` events. We track inventory changes through `order` and `offer` events that affect inventory.

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- Debouncing for rapid successive changes
- Priority queue for high-value products
- Partial field updates (not full re-index)
- Real-time sync status dashboard
- Sync retry logic with exponential backoff
- Webhook support for external triggers
