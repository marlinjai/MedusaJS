# Import Script Idempotency Implementation - Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

We have successfully transformed the manual customer import script from **PARTIALLY IDEMPOTENT** to **FULLY IDEMPOTENT** with comprehensive safeguards and user-friendly features.

---

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. Multi-Key Duplicate Detection ✅

**Location:** `busbasisberlin/src/modules/manual-customer/service.ts`

**New Method:** `findExistingCustomer(customerData)`

**How it works:**
- Checks for existing customers using multiple identifiers in priority order:
  1. **customer_number** (highest priority - most reliable)
  2. **internal_key** (system-generated unique key)
  3. **legacy_customer_id** (for migrated data)
  4. **email** (for business/legacy customers only)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates duplicates even when customer_number is missing
- ✅ Smart email matching (only for business/legacy to avoid false positives)
- ✅ Handles various data migration scenarios

---

### 2. Helper Methods for Lookups ✅

**New Methods Added:**

```typescript
async findByCustomerNumber(customerNumber: string): Promise<ManualCustomer | null>
async findByInternalKey(internalKey: string): Promise<ManualCustomer | null>
async findByEmail(email: string): Promise<ManualCustomer | null>
async findByLegacyCustomerId(legacyCustomerId: string): Promise<ManualCustomer | null>
```

**Purpose:**
- Modular lookup functions for code reusability
- Consistent normalization (trimming, case-insensitive for emails)
- Easy to test and maintain

---

### 3. Pre-Import Validation ✅

**Location:** `busbasisberlin/src/modules/manual-customer/service.ts`

**New Method:** `validateImport(csvData, fieldMapping)`

**Features:**
- Analyzes CSV data before making any changes
- Identifies:
  - How many customers will be created vs updated
  - Rows with missing unique identifiers (duplicate risk)
  - Validation errors that would cause failures
- Provides detailed warnings and error messages
- Returns summary: `{ willCreate, willUpdate, willSkip }`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents surprises during import
- ✅ Identifies data quality issues upfront
- ✅ Shows idempotency status before commit

---

### 4. Dry-Run Mode ✅

**Location:** Enhanced `importFromCSV` method

**How to use:**
```typescript
await service.importFromCSV(csvData, fieldMapping, { dryRun: true });
```

**Features:**
- Simulates the entire import process
- No database changes are made
- Returns what WOULD happen:
  - Which customers would be created
  - Which customers would be updated
  - Potential duplicates identified

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Safe testing of imports
- ✅ Preview changes before committing
- ✅ Verify idempotency without side effects

---

### 5. Improved Import Reference ✅

**Old format:** `csv-row-123`
**New format:** `import-2025-10-10T12-30-45-123-row-1`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Unique across multiple import sessions
- ✅ Timestamp shows when import occurred
- ✅ Traceable for audit purposes
- ✅ Easier debugging and support

---

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling ✅

**New Features:**

1. **Warnings Array**
   - Non-fatal issues that should be addressed
   - Missing unique identifiers
   - Potential future problems

2. **Strict Mode**
   - Stop on first error (optional)
   - Useful for production imports where partial imports are unacceptable

3. **Detailed Error Messages**
   - Row number included
   - Customer identifier included
   - Clear error reason

**Example:**
```
Row 42 (Customer: CUST123): Missing required field 'email'
```

---

### 7. Updated API Route ✅

**Location:** `busbasisberlin/src/api/admin/manual-customers/import/route.ts`

**New Capabilities:**

1. **Validation-Only Mode**
```bash
POST /admin/manual-customers/import
{
  "csvData": [...],
  "fieldMapping": {...},
  "options": { "validate": true }
}
```

2. **Dry-Run Mode**
```bash
POST /admin/manual-customers/import
{
  "csvData": [...],
  "fieldMapping": {...},
  "options": { "dryRun": true }
}
```

3. **Strict Mode**
```bash
POST /admin/manual-customers/import
{
  "csvData": [...],
  "fieldMapping": {...},
  "options": { "strictMode": true }
}
```

---

### 8. Enhanced Import Script ✅

**Location:** `busbasisberlin/src/scripts/import-manual-customers.ts`

**New Two-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Validation**
- Automatically runs before import
- Shows comprehensive report:
  ```
  📊 Validation Results:
     Total rows: 150
     Will create: 45 new customers
     Will update: 100 existing customers
     Will skip: 5 invalid rows
     Missing identifiers: 3 rows
  
  ✅ Idempotency Check: 100 existing customers will be updated
  ```

**Step 2: Import**
- Only runs after user confirmation
- Shows detailed results
- Includes helpful tips

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No surprises
- ✅ Clear expectations
- ✅ Idempotency status shown upfront
- ✅ Educational for users

---

## 🔄 How Idempotency Works Now

### Scenario 1: Re-importing Same File

**First Run:**
```
📊 Results:
   - Imported: 100 new customers
   - Updated: 0 existing customers
```

**Second Run (Same File):**
```
✅ Idempotency Check: 100 existing customers will be updated
📊 Results:
   - Imported: 0 new customers
   - Updated: 100 existing customers ✅ NO DUPLICATES!
```

### Scenario 2: Missing Customer Numbers

**CSV Without Customer Numbers:**
```csv
Kundennummer;Interner Schlüssel;E-Mail;Vorname
;KEY-001;user@test.com;John
```

**First Run:**
```
⚠️ Warning: Row 1 has no customer_number
📊 Results: 1 imported (will use internal_key for future updates)
```

**Second Run:**
```
✅ Found existing via internal_key: KEY-001
📊 Results: 0 imported, 1 updated ✅ NO DUPLICATES!
```

### Scenario 3: Mixed Data

**CSV with New + Existing:**
```csv
EXISTING-001;...  (already in database)
EXISTING-002;...  (already in database)
NEW-001;...       (new customer)
NEW-002;...       (new customer)
```

**Import Result:**
```
✅ Idempotency Check: 2 will update, 2 will create
📊 Results:
   - Imported: 2 new customers
   - Updated: 2 existing customers
```

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Priority-Based Identifier Matching

**Why:** Different data sources have different identifiers available

**Order:**
1. customer_number - Most reliable, human-readable
2. internal_key - System-generated, unique
3. legacy_customer_id - For migrated data
4. email - Reliable for business customers

### 2. Email Matching Only for Business/Legacy

**Why:** Walk-in customers might not have unique emails, or might share family emails

**Solution:** Only use email as unique identifier for business and legacy customer types

### 3. Two-Step Validation + Import

**Why:** Users need to understand what will happen before committing

**Solution:** Automatic validation before every import with clear reporting

### 4. Non-Breaking API Changes

**Why:** Existing code should continue to work

**Solution:** All new features are optional parameters:
```typescript
importFromCSV(csvData, fieldMapping, options?)
//                                   ^^^^^^^^ optional
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

See `IDEMPOTENCY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing instructions.

**Quick Tests:**
1. Import same file twice → should update, not duplicate
2. Import without customer_number → should use fallback identifiers
3. Run validation-only → should not modify database
4. Run dry-run → should preview correctly
5. Mixed new/existing → should handle correctly
