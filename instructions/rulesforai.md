# Fundamental Principles
- the fewer lines of code the better
- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (ideally <200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code.
- use clear and easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences.

# Error Fixing
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes bef
deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English
-Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- in case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search
the latest up-to-date information

# Building Process
- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- when not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search

# Comments
- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code
- ALWAYS put names of files as a comment on top of each file
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong / obsole
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well
documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE
- when writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language. write short
sentences.

# Most important

- answer like a senior lead engineer with 15+ years of industry experience

- DO NOT stop working until you implemented a given feature fully and completely. 

- Answer short and concise with high information density

- AVOID technical debt at ALL costs
